However, previous studies have shown that prosodic\nfeatures exhibit significant redundancy with both past and future words. Here,\nwe examine the time scale of this relationship: How many words in the past (or\nfuture) contribute to predicting prosody? We find that this scale differs for\npast and future words. Prosody's redundancy with past words extends across\napproximately 3-8 words, whereas redundancy with future words is limited to\njust 1-2 words. These findings indicate that the prosody-future relationship\nreflects local word dependencies or short-scale processes such as next word\nprediction, while the prosody-past relationship unfolds over a longer time\nscale. The latter suggests that prosody serves to emphasize earlier information\nthat may be challenging for listeners to process given limited cognitive\nresources in real-time communication. Our results highlight the role of prosody\nin shaping efficient communication.\n","authors":["Tamar I.

While prior work has assessed the success of online\ncollaborations, most approaches are time-agnostic, evaluating success without\nconsidering its longevity. Research on the factors that ensure the long-term\npreservation of high-quality standards in online collaboration is scarce. In\nthis study, we address this gap. We propose a novel metric, `Sustainable\nSuccess,' which measures the ability of collaborative efforts to maintain their\nquality over time. Using Wikipedia as a case study, we introduce the\nSustainPedia dataset, which compiles data from over 40K Wikipedia articles,\nincluding each article's sustainable success label and more than 300\nexplanatory features such as edit history, user experience, and team\ncomposition. Using this dataset, we develop machine learning models to predict\nthe sustainable success of Wikipedia articles. Our best-performing model\nachieves a high AU-ROC score of 0.88 on average. Our analysis reveals important\ninsights. For example, we find that the longer an article takes to be\nrecognized as high-quality, the more likely it is to maintain that status over\ntime (i.e., be sustainable). Additionally, user experience emerged as the most\ncritical predictor of sustainability. Our analysis provides insights into\nbroader collective actions beyond Wikipedia (e.g., online activism,\ncrowdsourced open-source software), where the same social dynamics that drive\nsuccess on Wikipedia might play a role.

While existing\npre-trained NLI models offer potential solutions, their performance remains\nsubpar compared to larger models on realistic RAG inputs. RAG inputs are more\ncomplex than most datasets used for training NLI models and have\ncharacteristics specific to the underlying knowledge base, requiring adaptation\nof the NLI models to a specific target domain.

Efficient Multi-turn Conversation Planning for LLMs\n  using Semantic Space","summary":"  Large language models (LLMs) are used in chatbots or AI assistants to hold\nconversations with a human user. In such applications, the quality (e.g., user\nengagement, safety) of a conversation is important and can only be exactly\nknown at the end of the conversation. To maximize its expected quality,\nconversation planning reasons about the stochastic transitions within a\nconversation to select the optimal LLM response at each turn. Existing\nsimulation-based conversation planning algorithms typically select the optimal\nresponse by simulating future conversations with a large number of LLM queries\nat every turn. However, this process is extremely time-consuming and hence\nimpractical for real-time conversations. This paper presents a novel approach\ncalled Semantic space COnversation Planning with improved Efficiency (SCOPE)\nthat exploits the dense semantic representation of conversations to perform\nconversation planning efficiently. In particular, SCOPE models the stochastic\ntransitions in conversation semantics and their associated rewards to plan\nentirely within the semantic space. This allows us to select the optimal LLM\nresponse at every conversation turn without needing additional LLM queries for\nsimulation. As a result, SCOPE can perform conversation planning 70 times\nfaster than conventional simulation-based planning algorithms when applied to a\nwide variety of conversation starters and two reward functions seen in the real\nworld, yet achieving a higher reward within a practical planning budget.

We reveal that, RRG with high performance on existing\nlexical-based metrics (e.g. BLEU) might be more of a mirage - a model can get a\nhigh BLEU only by learning the template of reports. This has become a pressing\nissue for RRG due to the highly patternized nature of these reports. In\naddition, standard radiology reports are often highly technical.

The scaling of these models, accomplished by increasing the\nnumber of parameters and the magnitude of the training datasets, has been\nlinked to various so-called emergent abilities that were previously unobserved.\nThese emergent abilities, ranging from advanced reasoning and in-context\nlearning to coding and problem-solving, have sparked an intense scientific\ndebate: Are they truly emergent, or do they simply depend on external factors,\nsuch as training dynamics, the type of problems, or the chosen metric? What\nunderlying mechanism causes them? Despite their transformative potential,\nemergent abilities remain poorly understood, leading to misconceptions about\ntheir definition, nature, predictability, and implications. In this work, we\nshed light on emergent abilities by conducting a comprehensive review of the\nphenomenon, addressing both its scientific underpinnings and real-world\nconsequences.

We then explore the\nconditions under which these abilities appear, evaluating the role of scaling\nlaws, task complexity, pre-training loss, quantization, and prompting\nstrategies.

We identify\nthree foundational shifts: 1) contextual coherence, where LRMs resolve\nambiguities and preserve discourse structure through explicit reasoning over\ncross-sentence and complex context or even lack of context; 2) cultural\nintentionality, enabling models to adapt outputs by inferring speaker intent,\naudience expectations, and socio-linguistic norms; 3) self-reflection, LRMs can\nperform self-reflection during the inference time to correct the potential\nerrors in translation especially extremely noisy cases, showing better\nrobustness compared to simply mapping X->Y translation. We explore various\nscenarios in translation including stylized translation, document-level\ntranslation and multimodal translation by showcasing empirical examples that\ndemonstrate the superiority of LRMs in translation. We also identify several\ninteresting phenomenons for LRMs for MT including auto-pivot translation as\nwell as the critical challenges such as over-localisation in translation and\ninference efficiency.

It still remains highly challenging to achieve satisfactory\nresults in complex logical problems, characterized by plenty of premises within\nthe context and requiring multi-hop reasoning. In particular, the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs are brittle to disorder and distractibility. In this work,\nwe first examine the mechanism from the perspective of information flow and\nreveal that LLMs confront difficulties akin to human-like cognitive biases when\ndealing with disordered and irrelevant content in reasoning tasks. However, in\ncontrast to LLMs, disordered and irrelevant content does not significantly\ndecrease human performance, as humans have a propensity to distill the most\nrelevant information and systematically organize their thoughts, aiding them in\nresponding to questions.Stem from that, we further propose a novel reasoning\napproach named Concise and Organized Perception (COP). COP carefully analyzes\nthe given statements to identify the most pertinent information while\neliminating redundancy efficiently. It then prompts the LLMs in a more\norganized form that adapts to the model's inference process. By perceiving\nconcise and organized context, the reasoning abilities of LLMs can be better\nelicited.

Existing\nmitigation strategies, such as differential privacy and neuron-level\ninterventions, often degrade model utility or fail to effectively prevent\nleakage. To address this challenge, we introduce PrivacyScalpel, a novel\nprivacy-preserving framework that leverages LLM interpretability techniques to\nidentify and mitigate PII leakage while maintaining performance. PrivacyScalpel\ncomprises three key steps: (1) Feature Probing, which identifies layers in the\nmodel that encode PII-rich representations, (2) Sparse Autoencoding, where a\nk-Sparse Autoencoder (k-SAE) disentangles and isolates privacy-sensitive\nfeatures,\n  and (3) Feature-Level Interventions, which employ targeted ablation and\nvector steering to suppress PII leakage.\n  Our empirical evaluation on Gemma2-2b and Llama2-7b, fine-tuned on the Enron\ndataset, shows that PrivacyScalpel significantly reduces email leakage from\n5.15\\% to as low as 0.0\\%, while maintaining over 99.4\\% of the original\nmodel's utility. Notably, our method outperforms neuron-level interventions in\nprivacy-utility trade-offs, demonstrating that acting on sparse, monosemantic\nfeatures is more effective than manipulating polysemantic neurons.

The prevalence of\ndata coupled with computational resources has led to large models with a\nconsiderable number of parameters. While the massive size of these models has\nled to remarkable success in many NLP tasks, a detriment is the expense\nrequired to retrain all the base model's parameters for the adaptation to each\ntask or domain. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) provides an effective\nsolution for this challenge by minimizing the number of parameters required to\nbe fine-tuned while maintaining the quality of the model.

While MLA improves memory\nefficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation\nlies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be\ntrained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits\nfully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different\nattention mechanisms?

While frontal placement is\nthe optimal and the only option for some tasks, such as hand tracking, it\nremains unclear if the same holds for full-body tracking due to self-occlusion\nand limited field-of-view coverage. Notably, even the state-of-the-art methods\noften fail to estimate accurate 3D poses in many scenarios, such as when HMD\nusers tilt their heads upward (a common motion in human activities).

Hence, this\npaper investigates the usefulness of rear cameras in the HMD design for\nfull-body tracking.

When only a handful of samples\nare available per category, as in Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA), data are\ninsufficient to fit a large number of parameters, rendering the above\nimpractical. This is especially true with large pre-trained Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs), which motivated successful research at the intersection of\nParameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) and FSA. In this work, we start by\nanalyzing the learning dynamics of PEFT techniques when trained on few-shot\ndata from only a subset of categories, referred to as the ``base'' classes. We\nshow that such dynamics naturally splits into two distinct phases: (i)\ntask-level feature extraction and (ii) specialization to the available\nconcepts. To accommodate this dynamic, we then depart from prompt- or\nadapter-based methods and tackle FSA differently. Specifically, given a fixed\ncomputational budget, we split it to (i) learn a task-specific feature\nextractor via PEFT and (ii) train a linear classifier on top.

More\nspecifically, we can only observe the (soft or hard) labels for some image\nsamples passed as input to the model. Furthermore, we consider an additional\nconstraint limiting the number of model calls, mostly focusing our research on\nfew-call model stealing. In order to solve the model extraction task given the\napplied restrictions, we propose the following framework. As training data, we\ncreate a synthetic data set (called proxy data set) by leveraging the ability\nof diffusion models to generate realistic and diverse images.

In particular, we demonstrate that it is\nineffective to directly generalize existing SSBAs to their clean-label variants\nby poisoning samples solely from the target class.

Motivated by this understanding, we propose to exploit content-relevant\nfeatures, $a.k.a.$ (human-relied) attributes, as the trigger patterns to design\nclean-label SSBAs.

Key operations in these filters are\ndilation and erosion, which determine the supremum or infimum for each pixel\nwith respect to an order of the tonal values over a subset of the image\nsurrounding the pixel. This subset is formed by a structuring element at the\nspecified pixel, which weighs the tonal values. Unlike grey-scale morphology,\nwhere tonal order is clearly defined, colour morphology lacks a definitive\ntotal order. As no method fully meets all desired properties for colour,\nbecause of this difficulty, some limitations are always present.\n  This paper shows how to combine the theory of the log-exp-supremum of colour\nmatrices that employs the Loewner semi-order with a well-known colour distance\napproach in the form of a pre-ordering. The log-exp-supremum will therefore\nserve as the reference colour for determining the colour distance. To the\nresulting pre-ordering with respect to these distance values, we add a\nlexicographic cascade to ensure a total order and a unique result. The\nobjective of this approach is to identify the original colour within the\nstructuring element that most closely resembles a supremum, which fulfils a\nnumber of desired properties. Consequently, this approach avoids the\nfalse-colour problem.

Existing methods either\nprioritize query examples likely to belong to known classes, indicating low\nepistemic uncertainty (EU), or focus on querying those with highly uncertain\npredictions, reflecting high aleatoric uncertainty (AU). However, they both\nyield suboptimal performance, as low EU corresponds to limited useful\ninformation, and closed-set AU metrics for unknown class examples are less\nmeaningful. In this paper, we propose an Energy-based Active Open-set\nAnnotation (EAOA) framework, which effectively integrates EU and AU to achieve\nsuperior performance. EAOA features a $(C+1)$-class detector and a target\nclassifier, incorporating an energy-based EU measure and a margin-based energy\nloss designed for the detector, alongside an energy-based AU measure for the\ntarget classifier. Another crucial component is the target-driven adaptive\nsampling strategy. It first forms a smaller candidate set with low EU scores to\nensure closed-set properties, making AU metrics meaningful. Subsequently,\nexamples with high AU scores are queried to form the final query set, with the\ncandidate set size adjusted adaptively.

This\nwidespread use and easy availability have unfortunately made SAR data\nsusceptible to malicious alterations, such as local editing applied to the\nimages for inserting or covering the presence of sensitive targets.\nVulnerability is further emphasized by the fact that most SAR products, despite\ntheir original complex nature, are often released as amplitude-only\ninformation, allowing even inexperienced attackers to edit and easily alter the\npixel content. To contrast malicious manipulations, in the last years the\nforensic community has begun to dig into the SAR manipulation issue, proposing\ndetectors that effectively localize the tampering traces in amplitude images.\nNonetheless, in this paper we demonstrate that an expert practitioner can\nexploit the complex nature of SAR data to obscure any signs of manipulation\nwithin a locally altered amplitude image. We refer to this approach as a\ncounter-forensic attack. To achieve the concealment of manipulation traces, the\nattacker can simulate a re-acquisition of the manipulated scene by the SAR\nsystem that initially generated the pristine image. In doing so, the attacker\ncan obscure any evidence of manipulation, making it appear as if the image was\nlegitimately produced by the system. This attack has unique features that make\nit both highly generalizable and relatively easy to apply. First, it is a\nblack-box attack, meaning it is not designed to deceive a specific forensic\ndetector. Furthermore, it does not require a training phase and is not based on\nadversarial operations.

It is common for multi-modal tasks that certain\nmodalities contribute more compared to other modalities, and if those important\nmodalities are missing, the model performance drops significantly. Such fact\nremains unexplored by current multi-modal approaches that recover the\nrepresentation from missing modalities by feature reconstruction or blind\nfeature aggregation from other modalities, instead of extracting useful\ninformation from the best performing modalities. In this paper, we propose a\nLearnable Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (LCKD) model to adaptively\nidentify important modalities and distil knowledge from them to help other\nmodalities from the cross-modal perspective for solving the missing modality\nissue.

In this\npaper, we propose GaussianIP, an effective two-stage framework for generating\nidentity-preserving realistic 3D humans from text and image prompts. Our core\ninsight is to leverage human-centric knowledge to facilitate the generation\nprocess. In stage 1, we propose a novel Adaptive Human Distillation Sampling\n(AHDS) method to rapidly generate a 3D human that maintains high identity\nconsistency with the image prompt and achieves a realistic appearance. Compared\nto traditional SDS methods, AHDS better aligns with the human-centric\ngeneration process, enhancing visual quality with notably fewer training steps.\nTo further improve the visual quality of the face and clothes regions, we\ndesign a View-Consistent Refinement (VCR) strategy in stage 2. Specifically, it\nproduces detail-enhanced results of the multi-view images from stage 1\niteratively, ensuring the 3D texture consistency across views via mutual\nattention and distance-guided attention fusion.

However, the existing model\ntreats all data equally without taking quality differences into account in the\ntraining process, resulting in noisy labels negatively impacting model training\nand unstable feature representations. In this paper, a data-driven alternating\nlearning (DALE) paradigm is proposed to optimize the model's training process,\nachieving stable and high-precision segmentation. The paradigm focuses on two\nkey points: (1) reducing the impact of noisy labels, and (2) calibrating\nunstable representations. To mitigate the negative impact of noisy labels, a\nloss consistency-based collaborative optimization method is proposed, and its\neffectiveness is theoretically demonstrated. Specifically, the label confidence\nparameters are introduced to dynamically adjust the influence of labels of\ndifferent confidence levels during model training, thus reducing the influence\nof noise labels.

This method restores the underlying\ndistribution of unstable representations, thereby enhancing the discriminative\ncapability of fuzzy region representations.

This allows us to rigorously track how the\nanisotropy of the data distribution (encoded by its power spectrum) interacts\nwith key parameters of the end-to-end sampling method, including the noise\namplitude, the step sizes in both score matching and diffusion, and the number\nof initial samples. Notably, we show that the Wasserstein sampling error can be\nexpressed as a kernel-type norm of the data power spectrum, where the specific\nkernel depends on the method parameters. This result provides a foundation for\nfurther analysis of the tradeoffs involved in optimizing sampling accuracy,\nsuch as adapting the noise amplitude to the choice of step sizes.\n","authors":["Samuel Hurault","Matthieu Terris","Thomas Moreau","Gabriel Peyr√©"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11615v1.pdf","comment":"38 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11612v1","updated":"2025-03-14T17:29:27Z","published":"2025-03-14T17:29:27Z","title":"Enhanced Soups for Graph Neural Networks","summary":"  Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in\nnumerous scientific and high-performance computing (HPC) applications.

As the evolution of these systems is governed by\npartial differential equations (PDEs), there are a number of computational\nsimulations which resolve these systems with high accuracy. However, as these\nsimulations incur high computational costs, they are infeasible to be employed\nfor large-scale analysis. A popular alternative to simulators are neural\nnetwork surrogates which are trained in a data-driven manner and are much more\ncomputationally efficient. However, these surrogate models suffer from high\nrollout error when used autoregressively, especially when confronted with\ntraining data paucity. Existing work proposes to improve surrogate rollout\nerror by either including physical loss terms directly in the optimization of\nthe model or incorporating computational simulators as `differentiable layers'\nin the neural network. Both of these approaches have their challenges, with\nphysical loss functions suffering from slow convergence for stiff PDEs and\nsimulator layers requiring gradients which are not always available, especially\nin legacy simulators. We propose the Hybrid PDE Predictor with Reinforcement\nLearning (HyPER) model: a model-agnostic, RL based, cost-aware model which\ncombines a neural surrogate, RL decision model, and a physics simulator (with\nor without gradients) to reduce surrogate rollout error significantly.

In particular, we demonstrate that it is\nineffective to directly generalize existing SSBAs to their clean-label variants\nby poisoning samples solely from the target class.

It is common for multi-modal tasks that certain\nmodalities contribute more compared to other modalities, and if those important\nmodalities are missing, the model performance drops significantly. Such fact\nremains unexplored by current multi-modal approaches that recover the\nrepresentation from missing modalities by feature reconstruction or blind\nfeature aggregation from other modalities, instead of extracting useful\ninformation from the best performing modalities. In this paper, we propose a\nLearnable Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (LCKD) model to adaptively\nidentify important modalities and distil knowledge from them to help other\nmodalities from the cross-modal perspective for solving the missing modality\nissue.

Prior work often addresses this task by\ntraining efficient task-specific adaptors that modify frozen layer weights or\nfeatures to capture relevant information without affecting predictions on\npreviously learned categories. While these adaptors are generally more\nefficient than finetuning the entire network, they still require tens to\nhundreds of thousands of task-specific trainable parameters even for relatively\nsmall networks, making it challenging to operate on resource-constrained\nenvironments with high communication costs like edge devices or mobile phones.\nThus, we propose Reparameterized, Compact weight Adaptation for Sequential\nTasks (RECAST), a novel method that dramatically reduces task-specific\ntrainable parameters to fewer than 50 - several orders of magnitude less than\ncompeting methods like LoRA. RECAST accomplishes this efficiency by learning to\ndecompose layer weights into a soft parameter-sharing framework consisting of\nshared weight templates and very few module-specific scaling factors or\ncoefficients. This soft parameter-sharing framework allows for effective\ntask-wise reparameterization by tuning only these coefficients while keeping\ntemplates frozen.A key innovation of RECAST is the novel weight reconstruction\npipeline called Neural Mimicry, which eliminates the need for pretraining from\nscratch.

While the massive size of these models has\nled to remarkable success in many NLP tasks, a detriment is the expense\nrequired to retrain all the base model's parameters for the adaptation to each\ntask or domain. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) provides an effective\nsolution for this challenge by minimizing the number of parameters required to\nbe fine-tuned while maintaining the quality of the model. While existing\nmethods have achieved impressive results, they mainly focus on adapting a\nsubset of parameters, weight reparameterization, and prompt engineering. In\nthis paper, we study layers as extractors of different types of linguistic\ninformation that are valuable when used in conjunction. We then propose the\nMixture of Layer Experts (MoLEx), a novel sparse mixture of experts (SMoE)\nwhose experts are layers in the pre-trained model. It performs a conditional\ncomputation of a mixture of layers during fine-tuning to provide the model with\nmore structural knowledge about the data. By providing an avenue for\ninformation exchange between layers, MoLEx enables the model to make a more\nwell-informed prediction for the downstream task, leading to better fine-tuning\nresults with the same number of effective parameters. As experts can be\nprocessed in parallel, MoLEx introduces minimal additional computational\noverhead. We empirically corroborate the advantages of MoLEx when combined with\npopular PEFT baseline methods on a variety of downstream fine-tuning tasks,\nincluding the popular GLUE benchmark as well as the End-to-End Challenge (E2E).\nThe code is publicly available at https://github.com/rachtsy/molex.\n","authors":["Rachel S.

Recently, different machine learning algorithms, such as\nGNNs, have been proposed to automate the pragma design via performance\nprediction. However, when applying the trained model on new kernels, the\nsignificant domain shift often leads to unsatisfactory performance.

Different\nexpert networks can learn to deal with different regions in the representation\nspace, and they can utilize similar patterns between the old kernels and new\nkernels. In the low-level MoE, we apply MoE on three natural granularities of a\nprogram: node, basic block, and graph. The high-level MoE learns to aggregate\nthe three granularities for the final decision.

When only a handful of samples\nare available per category, as in Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA), data are\ninsufficient to fit a large number of parameters, rendering the above\nimpractical. This is especially true with large pre-trained Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs), which motivated successful research at the intersection of\nParameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) and FSA. In this work, we start by\nanalyzing the learning dynamics of PEFT techniques when trained on few-shot\ndata from only a subset of categories, referred to as the ``base'' classes. We\nshow that such dynamics naturally splits into two distinct phases: (i)\ntask-level feature extraction and (ii) specialization to the available\nconcepts. To accommodate this dynamic, we then depart from prompt- or\nadapter-based methods and tackle FSA differently. Specifically, given a fixed\ncomputational budget, we split it to (i) learn a task-specific feature\nextractor via PEFT and (ii) train a linear classifier on top. We call this\nscheme Two-Stage Few-Shot Adaptation (2SFS). Differently from established\nmethods, our scheme enables a novel form of selective inference at a category\nlevel, i.e., at test time, only novel categories are embedded by the adapted\ntext encoder, while embeddings of base categories are available within the\nclassifier. Results with fixed hyperparameters across two settings, three\nbackbones, and eleven datasets, show that 2SFS matches or surpasses the\nstate-of-the-art, while established methods degrade significantly across\nsettings.\n","authors":["Matteo Farina","Massimiliano Mancini","Giovanni Iacca","Elisa Ricci"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11609v1.pdf","comment":"Camera-ready version for CVPR 2025 (w/ SuppMat, 23 pages)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11324v1","updated":"2025-03-14T11:45:10Z","published":"2025-03-14T11:45:10Z","title":"Safe-VAR: Safe Visual Autoregressive Model for Text-to-Image Generative\n  Watermarking","summary":"  With the success of autoregressive learning in large language models, it has\nbecome a dominant approach for text-to-image generation, offering high\nefficiency and visual quality.

This\nwidespread use and easy availability have unfortunately made SAR data\nsusceptible to malicious alterations, such as local editing applied to the\nimages for inserting or covering the presence of sensitive targets.\nVulnerability is further emphasized by the fact that most SAR products, despite\ntheir original complex nature, are often released as amplitude-only\ninformation, allowing even inexperienced attackers to edit and easily alter the\npixel content. To contrast malicious manipulations, in the last years the\nforensic community has begun to dig into the SAR manipulation issue, proposing\ndetectors that effectively localize the tampering traces in amplitude images.\nNonetheless, in this paper we demonstrate that an expert practitioner can\nexploit the complex nature of SAR data to obscure any signs of manipulation\nwithin a locally altered amplitude image. We refer to this approach as a\ncounter-forensic attack. To achieve the concealment of manipulation traces, the\nattacker can simulate a re-acquisition of the manipulated scene by the SAR\nsystem that initially generated the pristine image. In doing so, the attacker\ncan obscure any evidence of manipulation, making it appear as if the image was\nlegitimately produced by the system. This attack has unique features that make\nit both highly generalizable and relatively easy to apply. First, it is a\nblack-box attack, meaning it is not designed to deceive a specific forensic\ndetector. Furthermore, it does not require a training phase and is not based on\nadversarial operations.

While\nproviding a seemingly reasonable inductive bias, is this common practice\nlimiting the potential of modern LMs? Whitespace is not a reliable delimiter of\nmeaning, as evidenced by multi-word expressions (e.g., \"by the way\"),\ncrosslingual variation in the number of words needed to express a concept\n(e.g., \"spacesuit helmet\" in German is \"raumanzughelm\"), and languages that do\nnot use whitespace at all (e.g., Chinese). To explore the potential of\ntokenization beyond subwords, we introduce a \"superword\" tokenizer, SuperBPE,\nwhich incorporates a simple pretokenization curriculum into the byte-pair\nencoding (BPE) algorithm to first learn subwords, then superwords that bridge\nwhitespace. This brings dramatic improvements in encoding efficiency: when\nfixing the vocabulary size to 200k, SuperBPE encodes a fixed piece of text with\nup to 33% fewer tokens than BPE on average. In experiments, we pretrain 8B\ntransformer LMs from scratch while fixing the model size, vocabulary size, and\ntrain compute, varying *only* the algorithm for learning the vocabulary.

The average score across a wide range of benchmarks provides a\nsignal that helps guide the use of these LMs in practice. Currently, holistic\nevaluations are costly due to the large volume of benchmark questions, making\nfrequent evaluations impractical. A popular attempt to lower the cost is to\ncompute the average score on a subset of the benchmark. This approach,\nunfortunately, often renders an unreliable measure of LM performance because\nthe average score is often confounded with the difficulty of the questions in\nthe benchmark subset. Item response theory (IRT) was designed to address this\nchallenge, providing a reliable measurement by careful controlling for question\ndifficulty. Unfortunately, question difficulty is expensive to estimate. Facing\nthis challenge, we train a model that predicts question difficulty from its\ncontent, enabling a reliable measurement at a fraction of the cost. In\naddition, we leverage this difficulty predictor to further improve the\nevaluation efficiency through training a question generator given a difficulty\nlevel.

These\nphenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs\ncomputationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. This\nwork connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. We\nshow how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned\ntolerance in position perturbations.

Enhancing Large Language Models' Situated\n  Faithfulness to External Contexts","summary":"  Large Language Models (LLMs) are often augmented with external contexts, such\nas those used in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, these contexts\ncan be inaccurate or intentionally misleading, leading to conflicts with the\nmodel's internal knowledge. We argue that robust LLMs should demonstrate\nsituated faithfulness, dynamically calibrating their trust in external\ninformation based on their confidence in the internal knowledge and the\nexternal context to resolve knowledge conflicts. To benchmark this capability,\nwe evaluate LLMs across several QA datasets, including a newly created dataset\nfeaturing in-the-wild incorrect contexts sourced from Reddit posts. We show\nthat when provided with both correct and incorrect contexts, both open-source\nand proprietary models tend to overly rely on external information, regardless\nof its factual accuracy. To enhance situated faithfulness, we propose two\napproaches: Self-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence\nReasoning (RCR). SCR enables models to self-assess the confidence of external\ninformation relative to their own internal knowledge to produce the most\naccurate answer. RCR, in contrast, extracts explicit confidence signals from\nthe LLM and determines the final answer using predefined rules. Our results\nshow that for LLMs with strong reasoning capabilities, such as GPT-4o and\nGPT-4o mini, SCR outperforms RCR, achieving improvements of up to 24.2% over a\ndirect input augmentation baseline. Conversely, for a smaller model like\nLlama-3-8B, RCR outperforms SCR. Fine-tuning SCR with our proposed Confidence\nReasoning Direct Preference Optimization (CR-DPO) method improves performance\non both seen and unseen datasets, yielding an average improvement of 8.9% on\nLlama-3-8B.

However, as dataset scale increases, the training process\nbecomes increasingly inefficient due to the presence of low-value samples,\nincluding excessive redundant samples, overly challenging samples, and\ninefficient easy samples that contribute little to model improvement.To address\nthis challenge, we propose Scale Efficient Training (SeTa) for large datasets,\na dynamic sample pruning approach that losslessly reduces training time. To\nremove low-value samples, SeTa first performs random pruning to eliminate\nredundant samples, then clusters the remaining samples according to their\nlearning difficulty measured by loss. Building upon this clustering, a sliding\nwindow strategy is employed to progressively remove both overly challenging and\ninefficient easy clusters following an easy-to-hard curriculum.We conduct\nextensive experiments on large-scale synthetic datasets, including ToCa, SS1M,\nand ST+MJ, each containing over 3 million samples.SeTa reduces training costs\nby up to 50\\% while maintaining or improving performance, with minimal\ndegradation even at 70\\% cost reduction. Furthermore, experiments on various\nscale real datasets across various backbones (CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas)\nand diverse tasks (instruction tuning, multi-view stereo, geo-localization,\ncomposed image retrieval, referring image segmentation) demonstrate the\npowerful effectiveness and universality of our approach.

However, many existing methods struggle to fully leverage\nfeature heterogeneity and redundancy, thereby limiting their effectiveness. We\nuse the covariance matrix to model the feature heterogeneity and redundancy and\npropose Correlation-Aware Covariance Weighting (CACW) to adjust them. CACW\ncaptures these correlations through the covariance matrix, which is then\nprocessed by a nonlinear function to generate weights for adjustment. Building\nupon CACW, we introduce a general adaptive dual-level weighting mechanism\n(ADWM) to address these challenges from two key perspectives, enhancing a wide\nrange of existing deep-learning methods. First, Intra-Feature Weighting (IFW)\nevaluates correlations among channels within each feature to reduce redundancy\nand enhance unique information. Second, Cross-Feature Weighting (CFW) adjusts\ncontributions across layers based on inter-layer correlations, refining the\nfinal output. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of\nADWM compared to recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

This inconsistency leads to a growing distrust in\nexisting image metrics for SR evaluations. Though image evaluation depends on\nboth the metric and the reference ground truth (GT), researchers typically do\nnot inspect the role of GTs, as they are generally accepted as `perfect'\nreferences. However, due to the data being collected in the early years and the\nignorance of controlling other types of distortions, we point out that GTs in\nexisting SR datasets can exhibit relatively poor quality, which leads to biased\nevaluations. Following this observation, in this paper, we are interested in\nthe following questions: Are GT images in existing SR datasets 100\\%\ntrustworthy for model evaluations? How does GT quality affect this evaluation?\nAnd how to make fair evaluations if there exist imperfect GTs? To answer these\nquestions, this paper presents two main contributions. First, by systematically\nanalyzing seven state-of-the-art SR models across three real-world SR datasets,\nwe show that SR performances can be consistently affected across models by\nlow-quality GTs, and models can perform quite differently when GT quality is\ncontrolled. Second, we propose a novel perceptual quality metric, Relative\nQuality Index (RQI), that measures the relative quality discrepancy of image\npairs, thus issuing the biased evaluations caused by unreliable GTs.

Scene\nrepresentation, as a key module in the pipeline, has traditionally relied on\nconventional perception, which focus on the global scene. However, in driving\nscenarios, human drivers typically focus only on regions that directly impact\ndriving, which often coincide with those required for end-to-end autonomous\ndriving. In this paper, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving method called\nInsightDrive is proposed, which organizes perception by language-guided scene\nrepresentation. We introduce an instance-centric scene tokenizer that\ntransforms the surrounding environment into map- and object-aware instance\ntokens. Scene attention language descriptions, which highlight key regions and\nobstacles affecting the ego vehicle's movement, are generated by a\nvision-language model that leverages the cognitive reasoning capabilities of\nfoundation models. We then align scene descriptions with visual features using\nthe vision-language model, guiding visual attention through these descriptions\nto give effectively scene representation. Furthermore, we employ self-attention\nand cross-attention mechanisms to model the ego-agents and ego-map\nrelationships to comprehensively build the topological relationships of the\nscene. Finally, based on scene understanding, we jointly perform motion\nprediction and planning.

Based\non the detailed analysis, we introduce Concept-as-Tree (CaT), which represents\na concept as a tree structure, thereby enabling the data generation of positive\nand negative samples with varying difficulty and diversity for VLM\npersonalization. With a well-designed data filtering strategy, our CaT\nframework can ensure the quality of generated data, constituting a powerful\npipeline. We perform thorough experiments with various VLM personalization\nbaselines to assess the effectiveness of the pipeline, alleviating the lack of\npositive samples and the low quality of negative samples.

They are central in determining consumer behaviour through the\nutility-maximising consumer decision-making process.

Without the\nability to observe the decision-making mechanism, demand estimation becomes a\nchallenging task and current methods fall short due to lack of scalability or\nability to identify causal effects. Estimating these effects is critical when\nconsidering changes in policy, such as pricing, the impact of taxes and\nsubsidies, and the effect of a tariff.

For example, in the protein inverse folding\ntask, conditional diffusion models have achieved impressive results in\ngenerating natural-like sequences that fold back into the original structure.\nHowever, practical design tasks often require not only modeling a conditional\ndistribution but also optimizing specific task objectives. For instance, we may\nprefer protein sequences with high stability. To address this, we consider the\nscenario where we have pre-trained discrete diffusion models that can generate\nnatural-like sequences, as well as reward models that map sequences to task\nobjectives. We then formulate the reward maximization problem within discrete\ndiffusion models, analogous to reinforcement learning (RL), while minimizing\nthe KL divergence against pretrained diffusion models to preserve naturalness.\nTo solve this RL problem, we propose a novel algorithm, DRAKES, that enables\ndirect backpropagation of rewards through entire trajectories generated by\ndiffusion models, by making the originally non-differentiable trajectories\ndifferentiable using the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our theoretical analysis\nindicates that our approach can generate sequences that are both natural-like\nand yield high rewards. While similar tasks have been recently explored in\ndiffusion models for continuous domains, our work addresses unique algorithmic\nand theoretical challenges specific to discrete diffusion models, which arise\nfrom their foundation in continuous-time Markov chains rather than Brownian\nmotion.

The average score across a wide range of benchmarks provides a\nsignal that helps guide the use of these LMs in practice. Currently, holistic\nevaluations are costly due to the large volume of benchmark questions, making\nfrequent evaluations impractical. A popular attempt to lower the cost is to\ncompute the average score on a subset of the benchmark. This approach,\nunfortunately, often renders an unreliable measure of LM performance because\nthe average score is often confounded with the difficulty of the questions in\nthe benchmark subset.

This paper proposes a\nstructure-enhanced multimodal relationship prediction model (SMRP).

While the AUC and ACUPR\nscores of repositioning reach 99% and 61% respectively, the AUC of cold start\nachieve 80%. In particular, the cold start Recall indicator can reach more than\n70%, which means that SMPR is more sensitive to positive samples.

Finally, the model is\ndifferentiable and can be efficiently restricted to predict only a certain\naspect of the program behavior. Modelizer uses grammars to synthesize and\ninputs and unsupervised tokenizers to decompose the resulting outputs, allowing\nit to learn sequence-to-sequence associations between token streams.

The selection of\npredictors is crucial, strongly impacting both model accuracy and how well the\npredictions reflect ecological patterns. To ensure meaningful insights, input\nvariables must be carefully chosen to match the study objectives and the\necological requirements of the target species. However, existing SDMs,\nincluding both traditional and deep learning-based approaches, often lack key\ncapabilities for variable selection: (i) flexibility to choose relevant\npredictors at inference without retraining; (ii) robustness to handle missing\npredictor values without compromising accuracy; and (iii) explainability to\ninterpret and accurately quantify each predictor's contribution. To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce MaskSDM, a novel deep learning-based SDM that\nenables flexible predictor selection by employing a masked training strategy.\nThis approach allows the model to make predictions with arbitrary subsets of\ninput variables while remaining robust to missing data.

In\nparticular, EMN adopts randomly connected neurons to memorize the association\nof features and labels, where the signals in the network are propagated as\nimpulses, and the prediction is made by associating the memories stored on\nneurons based on their confidence. More importantly, EMN supports reinforced\nmemorization of feature mapping based on unlabeled data to quickly adapt to a\nnew domain. Experiments based on four cross-domain real-world datasets show\nthat EMN can achieve up to 10% enhancement of performance while only needing\nless than 1% timing cost of traditional domain adaptation methods.\n","authors":["Jianming Lv","Chengjun Wang","Depin Liang","Qianli Ma","Wei Chen","Xueqi Cheng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14598v2.pdf","comment":"15 pages,15 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19951v4","updated":"2025-03-17T08:33:00Z","published":"2024-11-29T18:59:54Z","title":"Sparrow: Data-Efficient Video-LLM with Text-to-Image Augmentation","summary":"  Recent years have witnessed the success of Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) in the vision understanding domain. The success of these models can\nlargely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger\nparameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably,\ndata scaling has mainly been powered by automatic data pipelines, which center\naround the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted\nfor quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these\ndata has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits\nscaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a\ndata-centric perspective. Our main study approach is fine-tuning pre-trained\nimage-LLMs with video data and investigating learning efficiency through data\nscaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning\nefficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through\nour probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this\nissue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes\nvideo-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic\nsamples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through\ncomprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves\nperformance comparable to or even superior to baselines trained with many more\nsamples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can\nboost the performance of long video understanding without training with long\nvideo data.

The dependence\namong graph nodes hinders the trivial adaptation of existing approaches on\nimages that assume inputs to be i.i.d. sampled, since many unique features and\nchallenges specific to graphs are not considered, such as the heterophily\nissue. Recently, GNNSafe, which considers node dependence, adapted energy-based\ndetection to the graph domain with state-of-the-art performance, however, it\nhas two serious issues: 1) it derives node energy from classification logits\nwithout specifically tailored training for modeling data distribution, making\nit less effective at recognizing OOD data; 2) it highly relies on energy\npropagation, which is based on homophily assumption and will cause significant\nperformance degradation on heterophilic graphs, where the node tends to have\ndissimilar distribution with its neighbors. To address the above issues, we\nsuggest training EBMs by MLE to enhance data distribution modeling and remove\nenergy propagation to overcome the heterophily issues. However, training EBMs\nvia MLE requires performing MCMC sampling on both node feature and node\nneighbors, which is challenging due to the node interdependence and discrete\ngraph topology. To tackle the sampling challenge, we introduce DeGEM, which\ndecomposes the learning process into two parts: a graph encoder that leverages\ntopology information for node representations and an energy head that operates\nin latent space. Extensive experiments validate that DeGEM, without OOD\nexposure during training, surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving an average AUROC improvement of 6.71% on homophilic graphs and 20.29%\non heterophilic graphs, and even outperform methods trained with OOD exposure.\nOur code is available at: https://github.com/draym28/DeGEM.\n","authors":["Yuhan Chen","Yihong Luo","Yifan Song","Pengwen Dai","Jing Tang","Xiaochun Cao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17912v2.pdf","comment":"The first two authors contributed equally to this work; ICLR 2025"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12912v1","updated":"2025-03-17T08:21:33Z","published":"2025-03-17T08:21:33Z","title":"Pose as a Modality: A Psychology-Inspired Network for Personality\n  Recognition with a New Multimodal Dataset","summary":"  In recent years, predicting Big Five personality traits from multimodal data\nhas received significant attention in artificial intelligence (AI).

The prevailing\nmethods typically learn a conservative policy to mitigate the problem of\nQ-value overestimation, but it is prone to overdo it, leading to an overly\nconservative policy. Moreover, they optimize all samples equally with fixed\nconstraints, lacking the nuanced ability to control conservative levels in a\nfine-grained manner. Consequently, this limitation results in a performance\ndecline. To address the above two challenges in a united way, we propose a\nframework, Adaptive Conservative Level in Q-Learning (ACL-QL), which limits the\nQ-values in a mild range and enables adaptive control on the conservative level\nover each state-action pair, i.e., lifting the Q-values more for good\ntransitions and less for bad transitions. We theoretically analyze the\nconditions under which the conservative level of the learned Q-function can be\nlimited in a mild range and how to optimize each transition adaptively.\nMotivated by the theoretical analysis, we propose a novel algorithm, ACL-QL,\nwhich uses two learnable adaptive weight functions to control the conservative\nlevel over each transition.

However, both Transformers and LRNNs struggle to perform\nstate-tracking, which may impair performance in tasks such as code evaluation.\nIn one forward pass, current architectures are unable to solve even parity, the\nsimplest state-tracking task, which non-linear RNNs can handle effectively.\nRecently, Sarrof et al. (2024) demonstrated that the failure of LRNNs like\nMamba to solve parity stems from restricting the value range of their diagonal\nstate-transition matrices to $[0, 1]$ and that incorporating negative values\ncan resolve this issue. We extend this result to non-diagonal LRNNs such as\nDeltaNet. We prove that finite precision LRNNs with state-transition matrices\nhaving only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity, while non-triangular\nmatrices are needed to count modulo $3$. Notably, we also prove that LRNNs can\nlearn any regular language when their state-transition matrices are products of\nidentity minus vector outer product matrices, each with eigenvalues in the\nrange $[-1, 1]$.

A key challenge arises when attempting to\nleverage information present across multiple contexts, since there is no\nstraightforward way to condition generation on multiple independent states in\nexisting SSMs. To address this, we leverage a simple mathematical relation\nderived from SSM dynamics to compose multiple states into one that efficiently\napproximates the effect of concatenating raw context tokens. Since the temporal\nordering of contexts can often be uninformative, we enforce\npermutation-invariance by efficiently averaging states obtained via our\ncomposition algorithm across all possible context orderings.

Anchor primitives serve as reference points for\npredicting non-anchor primitives across different LoDs to reduce spatial\nredundancy. For anchor primitives, we use the region adaptive hierarchical\ntransform to achieve near-lossless compression of various attributes. For\nnon-anchor primitives, each is predicted based on the k-nearest anchor\nprimitives. To further minimize prediction errors, the reconstructed LoD and\nanchor primitives are combined to form new anchor primitives to predict the\nnext LoD.

The\nmerit of these objectives lies in leveraging mask prediction tasks and\naugmented item representations to capture code correlations within individual\nitems and enhance the sequence modeling of the recommendation backbone.\nExtensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of CoCoRec, showing significant improvements over various\nsequential recommendation models.

Many recent works have\nshown that LLMs can significantly outperform conventional click-through-rate\n(CTR) prediction approaches. Despite such promising results, the computational\ninefficiency inherent in the current training paradigm makes it particularly\nchallenging to train LLMs for ranking-based recommendation tasks on large\ndatasets. To train LLMs for CTR prediction, most existing studies adopt the\nprevalent ''sliding-window'' paradigm. Given a sequence of $m$ user\ninteractions, a unique training prompt is constructed for each interaction by\ndesignating it as the prediction target along with its preceding $n$\ninteractions serving as context. In turn, the sliding-window paradigm results\nin an overall complexity of $O(mn^2)$ that scales linearly with the length of\nuser interactions. Consequently, a direct adoption to train LLMs with such\nstrategy can result in prohibitively high training costs as the length of\ninteractions grows. To alleviate the computational inefficiency, we propose a\nnovel training paradigm, namely Dynamic Target Isolation (DTI), that\nstructurally parallelizes the training of $k$ (where $k >> 1$) target\ninteractions. Furthermore, we identify two major bottlenecks - hidden-state\nleakage and positional bias overfitting - that limit DTI to only scale up to a\nsmall value of $k$ (e.g., 5) then propose a computationally light solution to\neffectively tackle each. Through extensive experiments on three widely adopted\npublic CTR datasets, we empirically show that DTI reduces training time by an\naverage of $\\textbf{92%}$ (e.g., from $70.5$ hrs to $5.31$ hrs), without\ncompromising CTR prediction performance.\n","authors":["Allen Lin","Renqin Cai","Yun He","Hanchao Yu","Jing Qian","Rui Li","Qifan Wang","James Caverlee"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01001v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03524v2","updated":"2025-03-15T14:18:53Z","published":"2025-03-05T14:08:53Z","title":"Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factor Disentanglement for Recommendation in\n  Various Context Scenarios","summary":"  In recommender systems, the patterns of user behaviors (e.g., purchase,\nclick) may vary greatly in different contexts (e.g., time and location). This\nis because user behavior is jointly determined by two types of factors:\nintrinsic factors, which reflect consistent user preference, and extrinsic\nfactors, which reflect external incentives that may vary in different contexts.\nDifferentiating between intrinsic and extrinsic factors helps learn user\nbehaviors better. However, existing studies have only considered\ndifferentiating them from a single, pre-defined context (e.g., time or\nlocation), ignoring the fact that a user's extrinsic factors may be influenced\nby the interplay of various contexts at the same time. In this paper, we\npropose the Intrinsic-Extrinsic Disentangled Recommendation (IEDR) model, a\ngeneric framework that differentiates intrinsic from extrinsic factors\nconsidering various contexts simultaneously, enabling more accurate\ndifferentiation of factors and hence the improvement of recommendation\naccuracy. IEDR contains a context-invariant contrastive learning component to\ncapture intrinsic factors, and a disentanglement component to extract extrinsic\nfactors under the interplay of various contexts. The two components work\ntogether to achieve effective factor learning. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world datasets demonstrate IEDR's effectiveness in learning disentangled\nfactors and significantly improving recommendation accuracy by up to 4% in\nNDCG.\n","authors":["Yixin Su","Wei Jiang","Fangquan Lin","Cheng Yang","Sarah M.

LAPIG consists of a projector-camera system\nand a target textured projection surface. LAPIG takes the user text prompt as\ninput and aims to transform the surface style using the projector. LAPIG's key\nchallenge is that due to the projector's physical brightness limitation and the\nsurface texture, the viewer's perceived projection may suffer from color\nsaturation and artifacts in both dark and bright regions, such that even with\nthe state-of-the-art projector compensation techniques, the viewer may see\nclear surface texture-related artifacts. Therefore, how to generate a projector\nimage that follows the user's instruction while also displaying minimum surface\nartifacts is an open problem. To address this issue, we propose projection\nsurface adaptation (PSA) that can generate compensable surface stylization. We\nfirst train two networks to simulate the projector compensation and\nproject-and-capture processes, this allows us to find a satisfactory projector\nimage without real project-and-capture and utilize gradient descent for fast\nconvergence.

In this\nwork, we introduce a novel approach that shifts from unlearning to an awareness\nparadigm by leveraging the inherent hierarchical properties of the hyperbolic\nspace.

Systematic reviews in comparative effectiveness research require\ntimely evidence synthesis. Preprints accelerate knowledge dissemination but\nvary in quality, posing challenges for systematic reviews.\n  Methods. We propose AutoConfidence (automated confidence assessment), an\nadvanced framework for predicting preprint publication, which reduces reliance\non manual curation and expands the range of predictors, including three key\nadvancements: (1) automated data extraction using natural language processing\ntechniques, (2) semantic embeddings of titles and abstracts, and (3) large\nlanguage model (LLM)-driven evaluation scores. Additionally, we employed two\nprediction models: a random forest classifier for binary outcome and a survival\ncure model that predicts both binary outcome and publication risk over time.\n  Results. The random forest classifier achieved AUROC 0.692 with LLM-driven\nscores, improving to 0.733 with semantic embeddings and 0.747 with article\nusage metrics.

We evaluate LLM-MTD on the benchmark Reddit\nSelf-Reported Depression Dataset (RSDD) and compare its performance against\nseveral competitive baseline methods, including traditional machine learning\nand fine-tuned BERT. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLM-MTD achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in depression detection, showing significant\nimprovements in AUPRC and other key metrics.

This inconsistency leads to a growing distrust in\nexisting image metrics for SR evaluations. Though image evaluation depends on\nboth the metric and the reference ground truth (GT), researchers typically do\nnot inspect the role of GTs, as they are generally accepted as `perfect'\nreferences. However, due to the data being collected in the early years and the\nignorance of controlling other types of distortions, we point out that GTs in\nexisting SR datasets can exhibit relatively poor quality, which leads to biased\nevaluations. Following this observation, in this paper, we are interested in\nthe following questions: Are GT images in existing SR datasets 100% trustworthy\nfor model evaluations? How does GT quality affect this evaluation? And how to\nmake fair evaluations if there exist imperfect GTs? To answer these questions,\nthis paper presents two main contributions. First, by systematically analyzing\nseven state-of-the-art SR models across three real-world SR datasets, we show\nthat SR performances can be consistently affected across models by low-quality\nGTs, and models can perform quite differently when GT quality is controlled.\nSecond, we propose a novel perceptual quality metric, Relative Quality Index\n(RQI), that measures the relative quality discrepancy of image pairs, thus\nissuing the biased evaluations caused by unreliable GTs.

An\nintuitive way for humans to express these goals is through abstract cues like\nverbal commands or rough sketches. Such human guidance may lack details or be\nnoisy. Nonetheless, we expect robots to navigate as intended. For robots to\ninterpret and execute these abstract instructions in line with human\nexpectations, they must share a common understanding of basic navigation\nconcepts with humans. To this end, we introduce CANVAS, a novel framework that\ncombines visual and linguistic instructions for commonsense-aware navigation.\nIts success is driven by imitation learning, enabling the robot to learn from\nhuman navigation behavior. We present COMMAND, a comprehensive dataset with\nhuman-annotated navigation results, spanning over 48 hours and 219 km, designed\nto train commonsense-aware navigation systems in simulated environments. Our\nexperiments show that CANVAS outperforms the strong rule-based system ROS\nNavStack across all environments, demonstrating superior performance with noisy\ninstructions. Notably, in the orchard environment, where ROS NavStack records a\n0% total success rate, CANVAS achieves a total success rate of 67%. CANVAS also\nclosely aligns with human demonstrations and commonsense constraints, even in\nunseen environments.

To\nhandle this problem, we present an effective ensemble method for DR diagnosis\ncomprising four main phases: image pre-processing, selection of backbone\npre-trained models, feature enhancement, and optimization. Our methodology\ninitiates with the pre-processing phase, where we apply CLAHE to enhance image\ncontrast and Gamma correction is then used to adjust the brightness for better\nfeature recognition.

However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image\nclassification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks,\nwhere both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of\nimages and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual\ndescriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore\ndefense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL\ndefense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial\ntraining (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and\ntext modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal\ndefenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic\none-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we\nconduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to\nenhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis\nshows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be\nwell-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by\nprior research. Our experiments show that MAT can effectively be applied to\ndifferent VL models and tasks to improve adversarial robustness, outperforming\nprevious efforts.

With the advancement of machine learning\n(ML) algorithms and the accumulation of naturalistic driving data, many ML\nmodels have been adopted for abnormal driving behavior detection (also referred\nto in this paper as \"anomalies\"). Most existing ML-based detectors rely on\n(fully) supervised ML methods, which require substantial labeled data. However,\nground truth labels are not always available in the real world, and labeling\nlarge amounts of data is tedious. Thus, there is a need to explore unsupervised\nor semi-supervised methods to make the anomaly detection process more feasible\nand efficient. To fill this research gap, this study analyzes large-scale\nreal-world data revealing several abnormal driving behaviors (e.g., sudden\nacceleration, rapid lane-changing) and develops a hierarchical extreme learning\nmachine (HELM)-based semi-supervised ML method using partly labeled data to\ndetect the identified abnormal driving behaviors. Moreover, previous ML-based\napproaches predominantly utilized basic vehicle motion features (such as\nvelocity and acceleration) to label and detect abnormal driving behaviors,\nwhile this study seeks to introduce event-level safety indicators as input\nfeatures for ML models to improve detection performance. Results from extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised ML\nmodel with the introduced safety indicators serving as important features.

This\nenables an establishment of precise corresponding features between distorted\nand original point clouds and significantly improves the accuracy of quality\nassessments.

We first investigate the\nspectrum aliasing problem in spectrum-based audio generation caused by existing\njoint diffusion methods. Through a comparative analysis of the VAE latent\nrepresentation of Mel-spectra and RGB images, we identify that the failure\narises from excessive suppression of high-frequency components during the\nspectrum denoising process due to the averaging operator. To address this\nissue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap\napplied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise\ndifferentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively\nenhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion. Furthermore,\nto improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we\nintroduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator\nthat provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview\ndiffusions. By refining swap timing and intervals, we can achieve a cross-view\nsimilarity-diversity balance in a forward-only manner. Quantitative and\nqualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms\nexisting joint diffusion methods and even training-based methods in audio\ngeneration using both U-Net and DiT models, along with effective longer length\nadaptation.

While this quality is primarily\nevaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures\nwhat makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from\nan optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a\nreward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective\nsuffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward\nmodel can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate\nmodels that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward\nmodel that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance,\nand thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a\nfundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or\nindependently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up\nto 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between\nreward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate.

Instead of forcing a\nsingle codebook to handle both semantic and perceptual information, DualToken\ndisentangles them by introducing separate codebooks for high and low-level\nfeatures, effectively transforming their inherent conflict into a synergistic\nrelationship. As a result, DualToken achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nboth reconstruction and semantic tasks while demonstrating remarkable\neffectiveness in downstream MLLM understanding and generation tasks.

Through causal\ninterventions, we trace and determine which neuron hidden states are essential\nfor the prediction of the model. By performing interventions and restorations\non each component of an LLM, we identify the importance of these components for\naspect-based sentiment classification. Our findings reveal that a distinct set\nof mid-layer representations is essential for detecting the sentiment polarity\nof given aspect words. Leveraging these insights, we develop a model editing\napproach that focuses exclusively on these critical parts of the LLM, leading\nto a more efficient method for adapting LLMs. Our in-domain and out-of-domain\nexperiments demonstrate that this approach achieves competitive results\ncompared to the currently strongest methods with significantly fewer trainable\nparameters, highlighting a more efficient and interpretable fine-tuning\nstrategy.\n","authors":["Shichen Li","Zhongqing Wang","Zheyu Zhao","Yue Zhang","Peifeng Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15117v1.pdf","comment":"AAAI2025"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15092v1","updated":"2025-03-19T10:44:37Z","published":"2025-03-19T10:44:37Z","title":"Towards Understanding the Safety Boundaries of DeepSeek Models:\n  Evaluation and Findings","summary":"  This study presents the first comprehensive safety evaluation of the DeepSeek\nmodels, focusing on evaluating the safety risks associated with their generated\ncontent.

The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture stands out\nfor its ability to scale model size without significantly increasing training\ncosts. Despite their advantages, current MoE models often display parameter\ninefficiency. For instance, a pre-trained MoE-based LLM with 52 billion\nparameters might perform comparably to a standard model with 6.7 billion\nparameters. Being a crucial part of MoE, current routers in different layers\nindependently assign tokens without leveraging historical routing information,\npotentially leading to suboptimal token-expert combinations and the parameter\ninefficiency problem. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the Layerwise\nRecurrent Router for Mixture-of-Experts (RMoE). RMoE leverages a Gated\nRecurrent Unit (GRU) to establish dependencies between routing decisions across\nconsecutive layers. Such layerwise recurrence can be efficiently parallelly\ncomputed for input tokens and introduces negotiable costs. Our extensive\nempirical evaluations demonstrate that RMoE-based language models consistently\noutperform a spectrum of baseline models.

These operations are well-suited for parallel execution using a\ntilebased approach. While traditional GPU programming often relies on low level\ninterfaces like CUDA or SYCL, Triton has emerged as a DSL that offers a more\nuser-friendly and portable alternative by programming at a higher level. The\ncurrent Triton starts at the workgroup (aka threadblock) level, and directly\nlowers to per-thread level.

Modern GPUs often\nfeature SIMD units capable of directly operating on tiles on a warp or\nwarpgroup basis, such as blocked load and blocked MMA. 2.

Specifically,\nthis paper (1) investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs in semantic\ncoherence evaluation and intent cluster naming, achieving over 95% accuracy;\n(2) designs an LLM-ITL clustering algorithm that facilitates the iterative\ndiscovery of coherent intent clusters; and (3) proposes task-specific\ntechniques tailored for customer service dialogue intent clustering. Since\nexisting English benchmarks pose limited semantic diversity and intent labels,\nwe introduced a comprehensive Chinese dialogue intent dataset, comprising over\n100,000 real customer service calls and 1,507 human-annotated intent clusters.\nThe proposed approaches significantly outperformed LLM-guided baselines,\nachieving notable improvements in clustering quality and a 12% boost in the\ndownstream intent classification task. Combined with several best practices,\nour findings highlight the potential of LLM-in-the-loop techniques for scalable\nand human-aligned problem-solving.

However, these models often\ngenerate videos that have misalignments with text prompts, especially when the\nprompts describe complex scenes with multiple objects and attributes. To\naddress this, we introduce VideoRepair, a novel model-agnostic, training-free\nvideo refinement framework that automatically identifies fine-grained\ntext-video misalignments and generates explicit spatial and textual feedback,\nenabling a T2V diffusion model to perform targeted, localized refinements.\nVideoRepair consists of two stages: In (1) video refinement planning, we first\ndetect misalignments by generating fine-grained evaluation questions and\nanswering them using an MLLM. Based on video evaluation outputs, we identify\naccurately generated objects and construct localized prompts to precisely\nrefine misaligned regions. In (2) localized refinement, we enhance video\nalignment by 'repairing' the misaligned regions from the original video while\npreserving the correctly generated areas. This is achieved by frame-wise region\ndecomposition using our Region-Preserving Segmentation (RPS) module.

While judge models -- LLMs\nfinetuned to specialize in assessing and critiquing model outputs -- have been\ntouted as general purpose evaluators, they are typically evaluated only on\nnon-contextual scenarios, such as instruction following. The omission of\ncontextual settings -- those where external information is used as context to\ngenerate an output -- is surprising given the increasing prevalence of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and summarization use cases. Contextual\nassessment is uniquely challenging, as evaluation often depends on practitioner\npriorities, leading to conditional evaluation criteria (e.g., comparing\nresponses based on factuality and then considering completeness if they are\nequally factual).

In this paper, we propose a federated\ncontinual learning strategy that employs a one-time model aggregation at the\nserver through multi-model distillation. This approach builds and updates the\nglobal model while eliminating the need for frequent server communication. When\nintegrating new data streams or onboarding new clients, this approach\nefficiently reuses previous client models, avoiding the need to retrain the\nglobal model across the entire federation. By minimizing communication load and\nbypassing the need to put unchanged clients online, our approach relaxes\nsynchronization requirements among clients, providing an efficient and scalable\nfederated analysis framework suited for real-world applications.

The scales of camera positions in\nthis monocular setting are ambiguous. Previous methods have acknowledged scale\nambiguity in multi-view data via various ad-hoc normalization pre-processing\nsteps, but have not directly analyzed the effect of incorrect scene scales on\ntheir application. In this paper, we seek to understand and address the effect\nof scale ambiguity when used to train generative novel view synthesis methods\n(GNVS). In GNVS, new views of a scene or object can be minimally synthesized\ngiven a single image and are, thus, unconstrained, necessitating the use of\ngenerative methods. The generative nature of these models captures all aspects\nof uncertainty, including any uncertainty of scene scales, which act as\nnuisance variables for the task. We study the effect of scene scale ambiguity\nin GNVS when sampled from a single image by isolating its effect on the\nresulting models and, based on these intuitions, define new metrics that\nmeasure the scale inconsistency of generated views. We then propose a framework\nto estimate scene scales jointly with the GNVS model in an end-to-end fashion.\nEmpirically, we show that our method reduces the scale inconsistency of\ngenerated views without the complexity or downsides of previous scale\nnormalization methods.

The challenge of identifying AGN and QSO has\nbeen discussed many times in the literature, often requiring multi-wavelength\nobservations. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify AGN and QSO\nfrom a single image.

We\ncondition the prediction of the central light distribution by masking the\ncentral few pixels of each source and reconstruct the light according to the\ndiffusion model. We further use this prediction to identify sources that\ndeviate from this profile by examining the reconstruction error of the few\ncentral pixels regenerated in each source's core. Our approach, solely using\nVIS imaging, features high completeness compared to traditional methods of AGN\nand QSO selection, including optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and X-rays.\n[abridged]\n","authors":[" Euclid Collaboration","G.

To address this challenge, we propose MaskHand, a novel generative\nmasked model for hand mesh recovery that synthesizes plausible 3D hand meshes\nby learning and sampling from the probabilistic distribution of the ambiguous\n2D-to-3D mapping process.

This learned distribution\nfacilitates confidence-guided sampling during inference, producing mesh\nreconstructions with low uncertainty and high precision.

The critical challenge\nunderpinning this task is ensuring both the fidelity of the generated images\nand their semantic alignment with the provided conditions. To tackle this\nissue, previous studies have employed supervised perceptual losses derived from\npre-trained models, i.e., reward models, to enforce alignment between the\ncondition and the generated result. However, we observe one inherent\nshortcoming: considering the diversity of synthesized images, the reward model\nusually provides inaccurate feedback when encountering newly generated data,\nwhich can undermine the training process. To address this limitation, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware reward modeling, called Ctrl-U, including\nuncertainty estimation and uncertainty-aware regularization, designed to reduce\nthe adverse effects of imprecise feedback from the reward model. Given the\ninherent cognitive uncertainty within reward models, even images generated\nunder identical conditions often result in a relatively large discrepancy in\nreward loss. Inspired by the observation, we explicitly leverage such\nprediction variance as an uncertainty indicator. Based on the uncertainty\nestimation, we regularize the model training by adaptively rectifying the\nreward. In particular, rewards with lower uncertainty receive higher loss\nweights, while those with higher uncertainty are given reduced weights to allow\nfor larger variability.

Due to this\ntone imbalance, machine learning models derived from these datasets can perform\nwell at detecting skin cancer for lighter skin tones. Any tone bias in these\nmodels could introduce fairness concerns and reduce public trust in the\nartificial intelligence health field.\n  Methods: We examine a subset of images from the International Skin Imaging\nCollaboration (ISIC) archive that provide tone information. The subset has a\nsignificant tone imbalance. These imbalances could explain a model's tone bias.\nTo address this, we train models using the imbalanced dataset and a balanced\ndataset to compare against. The datasets are used to train a deep convolutional\nneural network model to classify the images as malignant or benign. We then\nevaluate the models' disparate impact, based on selection rate, relative to\ndark or light skin tone.\n  Results: Using the imbalanced dataset, we found that the model is\nsignificantly better at detecting malignant images in lighter tone resulting in\na disparate impact of 0.577. Using the balanced dataset, we found that the\nmodel is also significantly better at detecting malignant images in lighter\nversus darker tones with a disparate impact of 0.684. Using the imbalanced or\nbalanced dataset to train the model still results in a disparate impact well\nbelow the standard threshold of 0.80 which suggests the model is biased with\nrespect to skin tone.\n  Conclusion: The results show that typical skin cancer machine learning models\ncan be tone biased. These results provide evidence that diagnosis or tone\nimbalance is not the cause of the bias. Other techniques will be necessary to\nidentify and address the bias in these models, an area of future investigation.\n","authors":["James Pope","Md Hassanuzzaman","William Chapman","Huw Day","Mingmar Sherpa","Omar Emara","Nirmala Adhikari","Ayush Joshi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06385v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15176v1","updated":"2025-03-19T13:02:01Z","published":"2025-03-19T13:02:01Z","title":"A Review on Large Language Models for Visual Analytics","summary":"  This paper provides a comprehensive review of the integration of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) with visual analytics, addressing their foundational\nconcepts, capabilities, and wide-ranging applications.

However, those manually collected images\noften exhibit bias, which is non-transferable across either categories or\ndomains, thus causing the model's generalization capacity degeneration. To\nmitigate this problem, we present a low-biased general annotated dataset\ngeneration framework (lbGen). Instead of expensive manual collection, we aim at\ndirectly generating low-biased images with category annotations. To achieve\nthis goal, we propose to leverage the advantage of a multimodal foundation\nmodel (e.g., CLIP), in terms of aligning images in a low-biased semantic space\ndefined by language. Specifically, we develop a bi-level semantic alignment\nloss, which not only forces all generated images to be consistent with the\nsemantic distribution of all categories belonging to the target dataset in an\nadversarial learning manner, but also requires each generated image to match\nthe semantic description of its category name. In addition, we further cast an\nexisting image quality scoring model into a quality assurance loss to preserve\nthe quality of the generated image.

While this quality is primarily\nevaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures\nwhat makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from\nan optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a\nreward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective\nsuffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward\nmodel can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate\nmodels that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward\nmodel that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance,\nand thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a\nfundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or\nindependently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up\nto 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between\nreward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate.

It enables\nknowledge sharing among different healthcare institutes while protecting\npatients' privacy. However, existing federated learning systems are typically\ncentralized, requiring clients to upload client-specific knowledge to a central\nserver for aggregation. This centralized approach would integrate the knowledge\nfrom each client into a centralized server, and the knowledge would be already\nundermined during the centralized integration before it reaches back to each\nclient. Besides, the centralized approach also creates a dependency on the\ncentral server, which may affect training stability if the server malfunctions\nor connections are unstable. To address these issues, we propose a\ndecentralized federated learning framework named dFLMoE. In our framework,\nclients directly exchange lightweight head models with each other. After\nexchanging, each client treats both local and received head models as\nindividual experts, and utilizes a client-specific Mixture of Experts (MoE)\napproach to make collective decisions. This design not only reduces the\nknowledge damage with client-specific aggregations but also removes the\ndependency on the central server to enhance the robustness of the framework.

Hence, it will be trustworthy if a model can\nprovide transparent illustrations on how to make the decision. Although many\nrule-based interpretable classification algorithms have been proposed, all\nthese existing solutions cannot directly construct an interpretable model to\nprovide personalized prediction for each individual test sample. In this paper,\nwe make a first step towards formally introducing personalized interpretable\nclassification as a new data mining problem to the literature. In addition to\nthe problem formulation on this new issue, we present a greedy algorithm called\nPIC (Personalized Interpretable Classifier) to identify a personalized rule for\neach individual test sample. To improve the running efficiency, a fast\napproximate algorithm called fPIC is presented as well. To demonstrate the\nnecessity, feasibility and advantages of such a personalized interpretable\nclassification method, we conduct a series of empirical studies on real data\nsets. The experimental results show that: (1) The new problem formulation\nenables us to find interesting rules for test samples that may be missed by\nexisting non-personalized classifiers.

However,\nthese systems still face challenges when extending their capabilities to long,\nmulti-speaker, and spontaneous dialogues, typical of real-world scenarios such\nas podcasts. These limitations arise from two primary challenges: 1) long\nspeech: podcasts typically span several minutes, exceeding the upper limit of\nmost existing work; 2) spontaneity: podcasts are marked by their spontaneous,\noral nature, which sharply contrasts with formal, written contexts; existing\nworks often fall short in capturing this spontaneity. In this paper, we propose\nMoonCast, a solution for high-quality zero-shot podcast generation, aiming to\nsynthesize natural podcast-style speech from text-only sources (e.g., stories,\ntechnical reports, news in TXT, PDF, or Web URL formats) using the voices of\nunseen speakers. To generate long audio, we adopt a long-context language\nmodel-based audio modeling approach utilizing large-scale long-context speech\ndata. To enhance spontaneity, we utilize a podcast generation module to\ngenerate scripts with spontaneous details, which have been empirically shown to\nbe as crucial as the text-to-speech modeling itself.

A Survey\n  and Outlook","summary":"  Time series analysis (TSA) is a longstanding research topic in the data\nmining community and has wide real-world significance. Compared to \"richer\"\nmodalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced\nexplosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality\nremains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA\nworks have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA\n(MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA\ncan benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a\ncomprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field.\nSpecifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation\nmodels of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for\nenhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further\ngroup the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio,\ntables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with\nfuture opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous\nmodality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the\nthree benefits.

To address this issue, this paper proposes the\nCuriosity-Diffuser, aimed at guiding the conditional diffusion model to\ngenerate trajectories with lower curiosity, thereby improving the reliability\nof policy. The core idea is to use a Random Network Distillation (RND)\ncuriosity module to assess whether the model's behavior aligns with the\ntraining data, and then minimize curiosity by classifier guidance diffusion to\nreduce overgeneralization during inference. Additionally, we propose a\ncomputationally efficient metric for evaluating the reliability of the policy,\nmeasuring the similarity between the generated behaviors and the training\ndataset, to facilitate research about reliability learning.

By organizing\nrecent works based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream\napplications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from\nvarious research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we\nhighlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with\npre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought\nforth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for\nthe evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical\nopportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.\n","authors":["Zhijie Nie","Zhangchi Feng","Mingxin Li","Cunwang Zhang","Yanzhao Zhang","Dingkun Long","Richong Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09165v3.pdf","comment":"Version 3: We added some latest works of LLM-based Embedders and\n  MLLM-based Embedders"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16252v1","updated":"2025-03-20T15:46:18Z","published":"2025-03-20T15:46:18Z","title":"Fin-R1: A Large Language Model for Financial Reasoning through\n  Reinforcement Learning","summary":"  Reasoning large language models are rapidly evolving across various domains.\nHowever, their capabilities in handling complex financial tasks still require\nin-depth exploration.

To enhance efficiency, we introduce caching and multi-angle\nranking strategies to optimize the retrieval process, significantly reducing\nresponse times and prioritizing relevant medical knowledge. Extensive\nevaluations on multilingual medical QA benchmarks across Chinese, Japanese,\nKorean, and Swahili demonstrate that MKG-Rank consistently outperforms\nzero-shot LLMs, achieving maximum 33.89% increase in accuracy, while\nmaintaining an average retrieval time of only 0.0009 seconds.\n","authors":["Feiyang Li","Yingjian Chen","Haoran Liu","Rui Yang","Han Yuan","Yuang Jiang","Tianxiao Li","Edison Marrese Taylor","Hossein Rouhizadeh","Yusuke Iwasawa","Douglas Teodoro","Yutaka Matsuo","Irene Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16131v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16094v1","updated":"2025-03-20T12:34:01Z","published":"2025-03-20T12:34:01Z","title":"Cultural Alignment in Large Language Models Using Soft Prompt Tuning","summary":"  Large Language Model (LLM) alignment conventionally relies on supervised\nfine-tuning or reinforcement learning based alignment frameworks.

When these\ndemonstrations come from a private dataset, the aligned LLM may leak private\ninformation contained in those private samples. In this work, we present the\nfirst study of aligning LLM behavior with private datasets. Our work proposes\nthe Private Steering for LLM Alignment (PSA) algorithm to edit LLM activations\nwith differential privacy (DP) guarantees. We conduct extensive experiments on\nseven different benchmarks with open-source LLMs of different sizes (0.5B to\n7B) and model families (LlaMa, Qwen, Mistral and Gemma). Our results show that\nPSA achieves DP guarantees for LLM alignment with minimal loss in performance,\nincluding alignment metrics, open-ended text generation quality, and\ngeneral-purpose reasoning. We also develop the first Membership Inference\nAttack (MIA) for evaluating and auditing the empirical privacy for the problem\nof LLM steering via activation editing. Our experiments support the theoretical\nguarantees by showing improved guarantees for our PSA algorithm compared to\nseveral existing non-private techniques.\n","authors":["Anmol Goel","Yaxi Hu","Iryna Gurevych","Amartya Sanyal"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18532v2.pdf","comment":"ICLR 2025 Camera Ready; Code: https://github.com/UKPLab/iclr2025-psa"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15990v1","updated":"2025-03-20T09:49:15Z","published":"2025-03-20T09:49:15Z","title":"ECKGBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models in E-commerce Leveraging\n  Knowledge Graph","summary":"  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capabilities across\nvarious NLP tasks.

In this paper, we propose TokenBridge, which bridges this gap by\nmaintaining the strong representation capacity of continuous tokens while\npreserving the modeling simplicity of discrete tokens.

To address these challenges, we present\nxvr, a fully automated framework for training patient-specific neural networks\nfor 2D/3D registration. xvr uses physics-based simulation to generate abundant\nhigh-quality training data from a patient's own preoperative volumetric\nimaging, thereby overcoming the inherently limited ability of supervised models\nto generalize to new patients and procedures. Furthermore, xvr requires only 5\nminutes of training per patient, making it suitable for emergency interventions\nas well as planned procedures. We perform the largest evaluation of a 2D/3D\nregistration algorithm on real X-ray data to date and find that xvr robustly\ngeneralizes across a diverse dataset comprising multiple anatomical structures,\nimaging modalities, and hospitals. Across surgical tasks, xvr achieves\nsubmillimeter-accurate registration at intraoperative speeds, improving upon\nexisting methods by an order of magnitude. xvr is released as open-source\nsoftware freely available at https://github.com/eigenvivek/xvr.\n","authors":["Vivek Gopalakrishnan","Neel Dey","David-Dimitris Chlorogiannis","Andrew Abumoussa","Anna M.

To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic\nframework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables\nflexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable\nquality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with\nour newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation.

To address this gap, we introduce Gaussian Eigen Models (GEM), which\nprovide high-quality, lightweight, and easily controllable head avatars. GEM\nutilizes 3D Gaussian primitives for representing the appearance combined with\nGaussian splatting for rendering. Building on the success of mesh-based 3D\nmorphable face models (3DMM), we define GEM as an ensemble of linear eigenbases\nfor representing the head appearance of a specific subject. In particular, we\nconstruct linear bases to represent the position, scale, rotation, and opacity\nof the 3D Gaussians. This allows us to efficiently generate Gaussian primitives\nof a specific head shape by a linear combination of the basis vectors, only\nrequiring a low-dimensional parameter vector that contains the respective\ncoefficients. We propose to construct these linear bases (GEM) by distilling\nhigh-quality compute-intense CNN-based Gaussian avatar models that can generate\nexpression-dependent appearance changes like wrinkles.

Recent benchmarks indicate that most\npublicly available datasets are biased towards optimal imaging conditions,\nleading to an overestimation of the methods' applicability to real-world\nindustrial scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Industrial Screen\nPrinting Anomaly Detection dataset (ISP-AD). It presents challenging small and\nweakly contrasted surface defects embedded within structured patterns\nexhibiting high permitted design variability. To the best of our knowledge, it\nis the largest publicly available industrial dataset to date, including both\nsynthetic and real defects collected directly from the factory floor. In\naddition to the evaluation of defect detection performance of recent\nunsupervised anomaly detection methods, experiments on a mixed supervised\ntraining approach, incorporating both synthesized and real defects, were\nconducted. Even small amounts of injected real defects prove beneficial for\nmodel generalization. Furthermore, starting from training on purely synthetic\ndefects, emerging real defective samples can be efficiently integrated into\nsubsequent scalable training. Research findings indicate that supervision by\nmeans of both synthetic and accumulated real defects can complement each other,\nmeeting demanded industrial inspection requirements such as low false positive\nrates and high recall.

This, in turn, helps forecasters\nresolve indecision during elicitation. We further show that truthful\nelicitation of imprecise forecasts is achievable using proper scoring rules\nrandomized over the aggregation procedure. Our approach allows DM to elicit and\nintegrate the forecaster's epistemic uncertainty into their decision-making\nprocess, thus improving credibility.\n","authors":["Anurag Singh","Siu Lun Chau","Krikamol Muandet"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16395v1.pdf","comment":"32 pages, 3 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09701v2","updated":"2025-03-20T17:47:44Z","published":"2023-08-18T17:52:12Z","title":"Do you know what q-means?","summary":"  Clustering is one of the most important tools for analysis of large datasets,\nand perhaps the most popular clustering algorithm is Lloyd's iteration for\n$k$-means.

To bridge this\ngap, we introduce LLM-SR, a novel approach that leverages the extensive\nscientific knowledge and robust code generation capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to discover scientific equations from data. Specifically, LLM-SR\ntreats equations as programs with mathematical operators and combines LLMs'\nscientific priors with evolutionary search over equation programs.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates {3D GU} tasks via autoregressive\nprediction. At its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization\nthat compresses 3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of\n3D structures. It then applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained\nstructural details, capturing key attributes such as atom types and precise\nspatial coordinates in microscopic 3D structures. We further propose two\noptimizations to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level\nsubtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to\n8x. The second is a masked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for\ndynamically varying token positions, significantly boosting model performance.\nBy combining these strategies, Uni-3DAR successfully unifies diverse {3D GU}\ntasks within a single autoregressive framework.

This definition yields a\nyes-or-no determination of whether extraction was successful with respect to a\nsingle query.

An\nessential aspect of modeling the SCM is to model the dependency of each\nvariable on its causal parents. Traditionally this is done by parametric\nstatistical models, such as linear or logistic regression models.

Recently, steering LLMs towards a desired behavior via activation\nediting has emerged as an effective method to mitigate harmful generations at\ninference-time. Activation editing modifies LLM representations by preserving\ninformation from positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) and minimising\ninformation from negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinations). When these\ndemonstrations come from a private dataset, the aligned LLM may leak private\ninformation contained in those private samples. In this work, we present the\nfirst study of aligning LLM behavior with private datasets. Our work proposes\nthe Private Steering for LLM Alignment (PSA) algorithm to edit LLM activations\nwith differential privacy (DP) guarantees. We conduct extensive experiments on\nseven different benchmarks with open-source LLMs of different sizes (0.5B to\n7B) and model families (LlaMa, Qwen, Mistral and Gemma).

Existing\ndata attribution methods for diffusion models typically quantify the\ncontribution of a training sample by evaluating the change in diffusion loss\nwhen the sample is included or excluded from the training process. However, we\nargue that the direct usage of diffusion loss cannot represent such a\ncontribution accurately due to the calculation of diffusion loss.

In many of these cases,\none needs to consider a collection of graphs, rather than a single network.\nThis could be a collection of distinct but related graphs, such as different\nprotein structures or graphs resulting from dynamic processes on the same\nnetwork. Examples of the latter include the evolution of social networks,\ncommunity-induced graphs, or ego-nets around various nodes. A significant\nchallenge commonly encountered is the absence of ground-truth labels for graphs\nor nodes, necessitating the use of unsupervised techniques to analyze such\nsystems. Moreover, even when ground-truth labels are available, many existing\ngraph machine learning methods depend on complex deep learning models,\ncomplicating model explainability and interpretability. To address some of\nthese challenges, we have introduced NEExT (Network Embedding Exploration Tool)\nfor embedding collections of graphs via user-defined node features. The\nadvantages of the framework are twofold: (i) the ability to easily define your\nown interpretable node-based features in view of the task at hand, and (ii)\nfast embedding of graphs provided by the Vectorizers library. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the usefulness of NEExT on collections of synthetic and real-world\ngraphs. For supervised tasks, we demonstrate that performance in graph\nclassification tasks could be achieved similarly to other state-of-the-art\ntechniques while maintaining model interpretability. Furthermore, our framework\ncan also be used to generate high-quality embeddings in an unsupervised way,\nwhere target variables are not available.\n","authors":["Ashkan Dehghan","Pawe≈Ç Pra≈Çat","Fran√ßois Th√©berge"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15853v1.pdf","comment":"24 pages, 10 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05655v2","updated":"2025-03-20T05:10:58Z","published":"2024-10-08T03:10:55Z","title":"Efficient Policy Evaluation with Safety Constraint for Reinforcement\n  Learning","summary":"  In reinforcement learning, classic on-policy evaluation methods often suffer\nfrom high variance and require massive online data to attain the desired\naccuracy.

Current efforts to reduce hallucinations\nprimarily focus on factual errors in knowledge-grounded tasks, often neglecting\nhallucinations related to faulty reasoning. Meanwhile, some approaches render\nLLMs overly conservative, limiting their problem-solving capabilities. To\nmitigate hallucination and laziness in reasoning tasks, we propose Automatic\nCurriculum Expert Iteration (Auto-CEI) to enhance LLM reasoning and align\nresponses to the model's capabilities--assertively answering within its limits\nand declining when tasks exceed them. In our method, Expert Iteration explores\nthe reasoning trajectories near the LLM policy, guiding incorrect paths back on\ntrack to reduce compounding errors and improve robustness; it also promotes\nappropriate \"I don't know\" responses after sufficient reasoning attempts. The\ncurriculum automatically adjusts rewards, incentivizing extended reasoning\nbefore acknowledging incapability, thereby pushing the limits of LLM reasoning\nand aligning its behaviour with these limits.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale\nIntegrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark\nunifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph\nmodalities.

With the development of data-driven\nmethods, traffic dynamics modeling has advanced significantly. However, TSE\nposes fundamental challenges for data-driven approaches, since historical\npatterns cannot be learned locally at sensor-free segments. Although inductive\ngraph learning shows promise in estimating states at locations without sensor,\nexisting methods typically handle unobserved locations by filling them with\nzeros, introducing bias to the sensitive graph message propagation. The\nrecently proposed Dirichlet Energy-based Feature Propagation (DEFP) method\nachieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance in unobserved node classification\nby eliminating the need for zero-filling. However, applying it to TSE faces\nthree key challenges: inability to handle directed traffic networks, strong\nassumptions in traffic spatial correlation modeling, and overlooks distinct\npropagation rules of different patterns (e.g., congestion and free flow). We\npropose DGAE, a novel inductive graph representation model that addresses these\nchallenges through theoretically derived DEFP for Directed graph (DEFP4D),\nenhanced spatial representation learning via DEFP4D-guided latent space\nencoding, and physics-guided propagation mechanisms that separately handles\ncongested and free-flow patterns.

However, data\nheterogeneity resulting from differences across user behaviors, preferences,\nand device characteristics poses a significant challenge for federated\nlearning. Most previous works overlook the adjustment of aggregation weights,\nrelying solely on dataset size for weight assignment, which often leads to\nunstable convergence and reduced model performance. Recently, several studies\nhave sought to refine aggregation strategies by incorporating dataset\ncharacteristics and model alignment. However, adaptively adjusting aggregation\nweights while ensuring data security-without requiring additional proxy\ndata-remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose Federated\nlearning with Adaptive Weight Aggregation (FedAWA), a novel method that\nadaptively adjusts aggregation weights based on client vectors during the\nlearning process. The client vector captures the direction of model updates,\nreflecting local data variations, and is used to optimize the aggregation\nweight without requiring additional datasets or violating privacy. By assigning\nhigher aggregation weights to local models whose updates align closely with the\nglobal optimization direction, FedAWA enhances the stability and generalization\nof the global model.
